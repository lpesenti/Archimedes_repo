    The Peterson model represents an ensemble of seismic spectra measured in a worldwide network (Peterson 1993,
    U.S. Geol. Surv. Rept. 2 93â€“322 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr93322). In this way it is
    possible to define a low noise model (NLNM) and an high noise model (NHNM) representing respectively the minimum and
    the maximum natural seismic background that can be found on Earth. Here we define these two curves.
