The following functions have been built to work with the data obtained by the Archimedes experiment.
The experiment save the data in a file .lvm containing 9 columns,

| ITF | Pick Off | Signal injected | Error | Correction | Actuator 1 | Actuator 2 | After Noise | Time |
|-----+----------+-----------------+-------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+------|
| ... | ........ | ............... | ..... | .......... | .......... | .......... | ........... | .... |
|-----+----------+-----------------+-------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+------|
| ... | ........ | ............... | ..... | .......... | .......... | .......... | ........... | .... |

ITF [V]            : signal from the interferometer
Pick Off [V]       : signal from the laser before the filters
Signal injected [?]: it has the shape of a sinusoid and it is necessary to make some operations with the signals
Error [-]          : it is given by the ratio between the ITF and the Pick Off minus some constant in order to translate
                     the result around the zero
Correction [-]     :
Actuator 1/2 [V]   : are the voltage coming from the two actuators before the amplification -> if one works, the other
                     should be off
After Noise [-]    :
Time [-]           : every 10 millisecond (100 rows) the system print the datetime in the format
                     -> 02/19/2021 20:01:11.097734\09

In the current configuration the sampling rate is 1 KHz but can be increase.
